# Monte-Carlo

Hi all ! 
I have created this as an example to illustrate how 
- Monte carlo can be done and how to analyse the results using a categorical sensitivity analysis method called kernel density estimation (KDE)
- which is different from a general correlation method in a way where you can assess which parameter causes higher percentage of success or failure

The system used here is a general projectile, propagated by Euler integrator ( you can try with higher integrators such as RK4,RK45) - have choosen this for running samples more than 100, again its personal choice on computation time and power.

Clearly have explained the code and theory in this - 'Monte Carlo_Analysistheory.pdf' file 

The MATLAB code I have built for the analysis of projectile motion(javelin throw) is also uploaded in the repository, which can be used as a reference for your future works !

The code output graphs and analysis is also clearly explained in the pdf file,

Cheers !!
